## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- 🎥 **Frame Extraction Tool:**  
  Used the frame extraction utility shared in the [Sheriyans Coding School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc7gpqMnnOSbU_F2-5MVVZw) video to convert a video into high-resolution image sequences.

- 📚 **Inspired By:**  
  Tutorials from Sheriyans Coding School (YouTube) that guide through creating smooth scroll-based animations with canvas and GSAP.

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShamirAli55/Frame-Sequence-Animation.git
````

2. Open `index.html` in a browser (use a local server for best results).

3. Scroll down to see the animation play frame-by-frame.

## 💡 Notes

* Ensure all frames (`frame_0000.jpeg` to `frame_0382.jpeg`) are inside the `Frames/` directory.
* For local development, use a live server (e.g., VSCode Live Server or Node/Express) to avoid CORS/image loading issues.
